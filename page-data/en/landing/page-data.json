A slot is the interface between a parachain and the relay chain. The number of slots is limited and they are allocated via DOT bidding auctions. ","a1-2":"The auction follows a modified \"candle auction.\" The first 2 days are an Open Period, and the next 5 days are an Ending Period. The auction will end at a random time during the Ending Period. The highest bidder at that random time is the winner. We expect there will be 5 auctions scheduled with about 7 days between auctions.","a1-3":"Similar Polkadot Slot Auctions will come in the future where projects will bids DOT for slots, but the bidding time, bidding period, and number of slots will be different from Polkadot.","q2":"Why is SubDAO bidding for a Slot?","a2":"By having a slot, SubDAO will be able to share in the security and consensus of the Polkadot network and will gain on-chain communication with other parachains.","q3":"Why is SubDAO running a DOT Crowdloan?","a3":"The Crowdloan is a way for SubDAO's community to provide the DOT required to win an auction, and is an important part of SubDAO's launch in Polkadot. It means the project can avoid selling many GOV to raise DOT for slot leases. At the same time, it's an opportunity to efficiently distribute GOV to those in the community who support SubDAO, which is part of the planned fair distribution of tokens.","q4":"Why should I participate in SubDAO's Crowdloan?","a4":"The Crowdloan is a low-cost way to obtain P-GOV tokens (exchangeable for GOV). Each 1 DOT you Crowdloan will get you 20 P-GOV. Your DOT is locked for a fixed period of time and then is spendable again, so you don't need to spend any money to get P-GOV. ","q5":"What is SubDAO Parachain Slot auction process?","a5-1":"1. You need to prepare your DOT by unlocking it in advance. It takes 7 days for your unlock to take effect.","a5-2":"2. Users can register and invite friends through an invitation link.","a5-3":"3. We are not participating in the the first Polkadot slot auction.","a5-4":"4. Staring with the second Polkadot slot open for bidding, the SubDAO Crowdloan will be created and users can contribute DOT for SubDAO.","a5-5":"5. SubDAO wins a slot!","a5-6":"6. SubDAO launches as a Polkadot Parachain.","q6":"When will SubDAO's crowdloan start?","a6":"SubDAO will create the Crowdloan when the second slot is open for bidding, and that's the time you can start to contribute DOT for SubDAO. The end time of the Crowdloan will be determined by the result of the auctions. Your DOT will be locked during the auction, even though SubDAO has not yet won. It will be unlocked at the end of the auctions or at the end of the slot lease that SubDAO wins.","q7":"Where can I participate in SubDAO crowd lending?","a7-1":"1. You can participate directly on this page (on-chain).","a7-2":"2. You can participate through participating exchanges (off-chain).","a7-3":"3. You can participate directly through the polkadot.js UI (on-chain).","a7-4":"4. You can participate through a third-party DApp (on-chain).","q8":"Where do the DOT I contributed reside?","a8":"Your DOT will be locked in the control module of the Polkadot relay chain through a special transaction. It is not transferred to a SubDAO account. You can still see these funds in the account, and SubDAO will never have access to it.","q9":"How long will my DOT be locked?","a9":"In the Polkadot Network, a parachain slot lease is up to 8 periods of 12 weeks each. SubDAO will go for the longest lease period of 96 weeks. When SubDAO's bid wins, your DOT will be locked for 48 weeks starting from SubDAO's win of the slot. If the SubDAO bid fails for all the slots being auctioned in this Crowdloan, your DOT will be unlocked and available as the Crowdloan ends.","q10":"How many P-GOV can I get as rewards for participating in the SubDAO Crowdloan?","a10":"If an auction is won, you will get 20 P-GOV as a reward for each DOT you contribute for SubDAO. A cap of up to 15 million P-GOV will be released on a first-come, first-served basis. If the bid fails, there will be no reward.","q11":"What is the referral reward?","a11-1":"SubDAO will grant users an additional 5% referral reward. Before starting the auction, you can register in advance and bond your referral relationship with your friends. Once your friends lock DOT for SubDAO, you and your friends can get referral rewards.","a11-2":"Example: After user A invites user B to participate in the slot auction, both A and B will receive an additional 5% of the support reward that user B would have received alone.","q12":"How do I receive rewards?","a12":"Rewards will be automatically distributed to your locked DOT account. The first 34% of your rewards will be released immediately after SubDAO connects as a parachain, and the remaining 66% of the rewards will be released monthly over the next 11 months.","q13":"Is there a maximum or minimum lock amount?","a13":"The single minimum lock amount is 0.1 DOT.","q14":"Can I contribute multiple times?","a14":"Yes","q15":"What is the relationship between P-GOV and GOV?","a15":"P-GOV (for SubDAO on Polkadot) and GOV (for Subdao on Polkadot) are the same token and will be exchangable 1:1 after the Subdao cross-chain bridge goes online. Because they are deployed as native tokens in different blockchain networks, they have different names.","q16":"Where can I track Crowdloan status?","a16":"After the Crowdloan starts, you'll be able to see SubDAO's Crowdloan total, crowd lenders, total rewards, the current bidding situation, and other information, all on this page.","alert":"Alert","install":"Install","pleaseInstallText":"No polkadot{.js} extension found, please install it first","twitterShareText":"Support SubDAO's Crowdloan in Polkadot Slot Auction!
